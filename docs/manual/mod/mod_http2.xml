        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/2 Direct Mode. This
                should be used inside a 
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to enable direct HTTP/2 communication for that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct communication means that if the first bytes received by the 
                server on a connection match the HTTP/2 preamble, the HTTP/2
                protocol is switched to immediately without further negotiation.
                This mode is defined in RFC 7540 for the cleartext (h2c) case. Its
                use on TLS connections not mandated by the standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a server/vhost does not have h2 or h2c enabled via
                <directive module="core" type="section">Protocols</directive>,
                the connection is never inspected for a HTTP/2 preamble. H2Direct
                does not matter then. This is important for connections that
                use protocols where an initial read might hang indefinitely, such
                as NNTP.
            </p>
            <p>
                For clients that have out-of-band knowledge about a server
                supporting h2c, direct HTTP/2 saves the client from having to
                perform an HTTP/1.1 upgrade, resulting in better performance
                and avoiding the Upgrade restrictions on request bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes direct h2c attractive for server to server communication
                as well, when the connection can be trusted or is secured by other means.

        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/2 server push 
                protocol feature. This should be used inside a 
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to enable direct HTTP/2 communication for that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The HTTP/2 protocol allows the server to push other resources to
                a client when it asked for a particular one. This is helpful
                if those resources are connected in some way and the client can
                be expected to ask for it anyway. The pushing then saves the
                time it takes the client to ask for the resources itself. On the
                other hand, pushing resources the client never needs or already
                has is a waste of bandwidth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Server pushes are detected by inspecting the <code>Link</code> headers of
                responses (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 for the 
                specification). When a link thus specified has the <code>rel=preload</code>
                attribute, it is treated as a resource to be pushed.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Link headers in responses are either set by the application or
                can be configured via <module>mod_headers</module> as:
            </p>
            <example><title>mod_headers example</title>
                <highlight language="config">
&lt;Location /index.html&gt;
    Header add Link "&lt;/css/site.css&gt;;rel=preload"
    Header add Link "&lt;/images/logo.jpg&gt;;rel=preload"
&lt;/Location&gt;
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                As the example shows, there can be several link headers added
                to a response, resulting in several pushes being triggered. There
                are no checks in the module to avoid pushing the same resource
                twice or more to one client. Use with care.
            </p>
            <p> 
                HTTP/2 server pushes are enabled by default. This directive 
                allows it to be switch off on all resources of this server/virtual
                host.

            </example>
            <p>
                Last but not least, pushes happen only when the client signals
                its willingness to accept those. Most browsers do, some, like Safari 9,
                do not. Also, pushes also only happen for resources from the same
                <em>authority</em> as the original response is for.

                This directive toggles the maximum number of HTTP/2 server pushes 
                that are remembered per HTTP/2 connection. This can be used inside the
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to influence the number for all connections to that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The push diary records a digest (currently using a 64 bit number) of pushed
                resources (their URL) to avoid duplicate pushes on the same connection.
                These value are not persisted, so clients openeing a new connection
                will experience known pushes again. There is ongoing work to enable
                a client to disclose a digest of the resources it already has, so
                the diary maybe initialized by the client on each connection setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the maximum size is reached, newer entries replace the oldest
                ones. A diary entry uses 8 bytes, letting a
                default diary with 256 entries consume around 2 KB of memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                A size of 0 will effectively disable the push diary.

        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive defines the priority handling of pushed responses
                based on the content-type of the response. This is usually defined
                per server config, but may also appear in a virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP/2 server pushes are always related to a client request. Each
                such request/response pairs, or <em>streams</em> have a dependency
                and a weight, together defining the <em>priority</em> of a stream. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a stream <em>depends</em> on another, say X depends on Y,
                then Y gets all bandwidth before X gets any. Note that this
                does not men that Y will block X. If Y has no data to send, 
                all bandwidth allocated to Y can be used by X.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a stream has more than one dependant, say X1 and X2 both
                depend on Y, the <em>weight</em> determines the bandwidth
                allocation. If X1 and X2 have the same weight, they both get
                half of the available bandwdith. If the weight of X1 is twice
                as large as that for X2, X1 gets twice the bandwidth of X2.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ultimately, every stream depends on the <em>root</em> stream which
                gets all the bandwidht available, but never sends anything. So all
                its bandwidth is distributed by weight among its children. Which
                either have data to send or distribute the bandwidth to their
                own children. And so on. If none of the children have data
                to send, that bandwidth get distributed somewhere else according
                to the same rules.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The purpose of this priority system is to always make use of
                available bandwidth while allowing precedence and weight
                to be given to specific streams. Since, normally, all streams
                are initiated by the client, it is also the one that sets
                these priorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only when such a stream results in a PUSH, gets the server to
                decide what the <em>initial</em> priority of such a pushed
                stream is. In the examples below, X is the client stream. It
                depends on Y and the server decides to PUSH streams P1 and P2
                onto X.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default priority rule is:
            </p>
            <example><title>Default Priority Rule</title>
                <highlight language="config">
                    H2PushPriority * After 16
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                which reads as 'Send a pushed stream of any content-type
                depending on the client stream with weight 16'. And so P1
                and P2 will be send after X and, as they have equal weight,
                share bandwidth equally among themselves.
            </p>
            <example><title>Interleaved Priority Rule</title>
                <highlight language="config">
                    H2PushPriority text/css Interleaved 256
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                which reads as 'Send any CSS resource on the same dependency and
                weight as the client stream'. If P1 has content-type 'text/css',
                it will depend on Y (as does X) and its effective weight will be
                calculated as <code>P1ew = Xw * (P1w / 256)</code>. With P1w being 
                256, this will make the effective weight the same as the weight
                of X. If both X and P1 have data to send, bandwidth will be allocated
                to both equally.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Pw specified as 512, a pushed, interleaved stream would
                get double the weight of X. With 128 only half as much. Note that
                effective weights are always capped at 256.
            </p>
            <example><title>Before Priority Rule</title>
                <highlight language="config">
                    H2PushPriority application/json Before
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                This says that any pushed stream of content type 'application/json'
                should be send out <em>before</em> X. This makes P1 dependent
                on Y and X dependent on P1. So, X will be stalled as long as
                P1 has data to send. The effective weight is inherited from the
                client stream. Specifying a weight is not allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be aware that the effect of priority specifications is limited
                by the available server resources. If a server does not have
                workers available for pushed streams, the data for the stream
                may only ever arrive when other streams have been finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last, but not least, there are some specifics of the syntax
                to be used in this directive:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>'*' is the only special content-type that matches all others. 
                 'image/*' will not work.</li>
                <li>The default dependency is 'After'. </li>
                <li>There are also default weights: for 'After' it is 16, 'interleaved' is 256. 
                </li>
            </ol>

                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade method 
                for switching to HTTP/2. This
                should be used inside a 
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to enable Upgrades to HTTP/2 for that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This method of switching protocols is defined in HTTP/1.1 and
                uses the "Upgrade" header (thus the name) to announce willingness
                to use another protocol. This may happen on any request of a
                HTTP/1.1 connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method of protocol switching is enabled by default on cleartext
                (potential h2c) connections and disabled on TLS (potential h2), 
                as mandated by RFC 7540. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be aware that Upgrades are only accepted for requests
                that carry no body. POSTs and PUTs with content will never
                trigger an upgrade to HTTP/2. 
                See <directive type="section">H2Direct</directive> for an 
                alternative to Upgrade.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mode only has an effect when h2 or h2c is enabled via
                the <directive module="core" type="section">Protocols</directive>.

            <p>
                This directive sets maximum number of <em>extra</em> file handles
                a HTTP/2 session is allowed to use. A file handle is counted as
                <em>extra</em> when it is transferred from a h2 worker thread to
                the main HTTP/2 connection handling. This commonly happens when
                serving static files.
            </p><p>
                Depending on the processing model configured on the server, the
                number of connections times number of active streams may exceed
                the number of file handles for the process. On the other hand,
                converting every file into memory bytes early results in too 
                many buffer writes. This option helps to mitigate that.
            </p><p>
                The number of file handles used by a server process is then in
                the order of:
            </p>
            <pre>
                (h2_connections * extra_files) + (h2_max_worker)

            <p>
                If nothing is configured, the module tries to make a conservative
                guess how many files are safe to use. This depends largely on the 
                MPM chosen.

        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive toggles the security checks on HTTP/2 connections
                in TLS mode (https:). This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The security checks require that the TSL protocol is at least
                TLSv1.2 and that none of the ciphers listed in RFC 7540, Appendix A
                is used. These checks will be extended once new security requirements
                come into place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name stems from the 
                <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS">Security/Server Side TLS</a>
                definitions at mozilla where "modern compatibility" is defined. Mozilla Firefox and
                other browsers require modern compatibility for HTTP/2 connections. As everything
                in OpSec, this is a moving target and can be expected to evolve in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                One purpose of having these checks in mod_http2 is to enforce this
                security level for all connections, not only those from browsers. The other
                purpose is to prevent the negotiation of HTTP/2 as a protocol should
                the requirements not be met.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the security of the TLS connection is determined by the
                server configuration directives for mod_ssl.

                This directive sets the number of bytes to be sent in small
                TLS records (~1300 bytes) until doing maximum sized writes (16k)
                on https: HTTP/2 connections.
                This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Measurements by <a href="https://www.igvita.com">google performance
                labs</a> show that best performance on TLS connections is reached,
                if initial record sizes stay below the MTU level, to allow a
                complete record to fit into an IP packet.
            </p>
            <p>
                While TCP adjust its flow-control and window sizes, longer TLS
                records can get stuck in queues or get lost and need retransmission.
                This is of course true for all packets. TLS however needs the 
                whole record in order to decrypt it. Any missing bytes at the end
                will stall usage of the received ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a sufficient number of bytes have been send successfully,
                the TCP state of the connection is stable and maximum TLS record
                sizes (16 KB) can be used for optimal performance.

            <p>
                In deployments where servers are reached locally or over reliable

                any warmup phase altogether.
            </p>

                This directive sets the number of seconds of idle time on a TLS
                connection before the TLS write size falls back to small (~1300 bytes)
                length.

                See <directive type="section">H2TLSWarmUpSize</directive> for a
                description of TLS warmup. H2TLSCoolDownSecs reflects the fact
                that connections may deteriorate over time (and TCP flow adjusts)
                for idle connections as well. It is beneficial to overall performance
                to fall back to the pre-warmup phase after a number of seconds that
                no data has been sent. 
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                This directive sets the timeout for read/write operations on
                connections where HTTP/2 is negotiated. This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This directive is similar to the 
                <directive module="core" type="section">Timeout</directive>, but
                applies only to HTTP/2 connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                A value of 0 enforces no timeout.

                This directive sets the timeout for read/write operations on
                idle connections where HTTP/2 is negotiated. This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s.

            <p>
                This directive is similar to the 
                <directive module="core" type="section">KeepAliveTimeout</directive>, but
                applies only to HTTP/2 connections. A HTTP/2 connection is considered
                idle when no streams are open, e.g. no requests are ongoing.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, for non-async MPMs (prefork, worker) the keepalive timeout
                will be the same as H2Timeout. For async MPMs, the keepalive handling for
                HTTP/1 connections applies as no special action is taken.

        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive sets the timeout for read/write operations on
                HTTP/2 streams, e.g. individual requests. This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the nature of HTTP/2, which sends multiple requests over a single
                connection and has priority scheduling, individual streams might not
                see input for much longer times than HTTP/1.1 requests would. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A value of 0 enforces no timeout, so could wait on chances to receive
                input or write data indefinitely. This expose a server to
                risks of thread exhaustion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on your handling of pushed streams,
                priorities and general responsiveness, a site might need to increase
                this value. For example, if you PUSH a large resource <em>before</em>
                the requested one, the initial stream will not write until the
                pushed resource is fully sent.
