Contributors looking for a mission:

  * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

  * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

  * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

    After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.4.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur after 2.4.1.  Such changes can
    only be made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.4.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk
    then merge into branches/2.4.x, as applicable.

OTHER PROPOSALS

   * opinion on more complete DefaultRuntimeDir use in 2.4.x?
     o If a module has a config directive for the run-time file that
       treats the configured path as relative to server root, preserve
       that behavior but change the location when not configured to
       respect DefaultRuntimeDir.  With these changes, users with no
       per-runtime-file configuration directives can control
       everything with DefaultRuntimeDir.
       BUT: Existing users of DefaultRuntimeDir might get a short-term scare
       when some unconfigured run-time file starts respecting their
       DefaultRuntimeDir directive after an upgrade.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.

   * mod_ssl: Add RFC 5878 support. This allows support of mechansisms
              such as Certificate Transparency. Note that new
              mechanisms are supported without software updates.

     -1: kbrand
     druggeri note: Needs docs for new directive
     kbrand: depends on an unreleased OpenSSL version (1.0.2), and
             RFC 5878 is of "Category: Experimental".
             The API in the OpenSSL implementation from May 2012
             (http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22601) only covers the
             privately-defined TLSEXT_AUTHZDATAFORMAT_audit_proof, there's
             no support for x509_attr_cert (section 3.3.1 in RFC 5878) or
             saml_assertion (3.3.2). SSL_CTX_use_authz_file doesn't have
             any docs in OpenSSL, either, and there's no "openssl foo ..."
             command or similar to create/manage such files.
             Additionally, httpd-2.4-rfc5878.patch includes a build-system
             change which is unrelated to this feature.
             Note: as of 2013-04-15, r1352596 has been reverted in trunk
             (with r1468131), for the reasons explained in the message with id
             <515FED7C.5010009@velox.ch> sent to the dev list on 2013-04-06.
     ben: not correct that it depends on OpenSSL 1.0.2, it builds with
          any version. Also, if you read my note to dev@ you will see
          why it is not premature.
     minfrin: once this gets docs, +1.

     +1 fuankg, gsmith
     -.8: trawick
          This commit is essentially deciding that an httpd install on
          Windows now has printenv/testcgi written in 2 more languages.
          To the extent that the usefulness is that it shows how to make scripts
          of these types executable by httpd, I believe that the documentation
          is the proper place to solve that.  To the extent that the usefullness
          is to show how to implement a CGI in these particular languages, I believe
          that the httpd distribution and documentation in general is not the
          place for that.  Historically these types of scripts have caused problems
          for downstream vendorsas well as newbies (and sometimes the intersection
          of those two groups) who don't understand that these are information leaks
          once they are enabled, and the subtlety of the way they are disabled ("Apache
          messed up the first line; let me fix that") contributes to that.
     fuankg notes: I've just added a big warning to all CGI scripts which should now
          make absolutely clear that these CGIs are for testing purpose only - so those
          who enable those scripts with inserting the right shebang should be 100% aware
          of any risks (this should cover your last point).
     jim: trawick, does the above address your concerns?
     trawick: to some extent (somebody reading the script gets an idea)
          Why isn't the configuration requirement documented instead
          of described indirectly in a sample?
          Why are these new samples added to the install without three
          votes?  (I didn't veto it; put your name next to the two
          existing ones and I'll be satisified that enough people
          considered this addition as an appropriate solution for a
          real httpd usability problem.)
     wrowe: I'd agree with trawick, and suggest that these scripts can begin
            their life somewhere in the manual/ tree.  This really seems like
            the place where /usr/share/httpd/examples/ would be useful, but
            there isn't an ordinary directory for that.  Since we want none
            of the scripts to function 'out of the box', what about a new
            cgi-examples/ dir alongside cgi-bin/? Otherwise manual/cgi/examples
            might work?
